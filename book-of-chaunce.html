    <p>And then the LORD spake unto the Moses saying, "Now that you art free from exams forever, I shall put my sign upon thou. It shall verily be a mark showing that you must read countless pages of German bible commentary and translate them yourself. All the peoples surrounding you will see this mark and will weep and gnash their teeth when they see you. But lo, in the next months your academic German shall shine like the dawn, and your germanic syntax shall pour forth light as the new morning." Then Moses replied to the LORD saying, "Oh LORD, what purpose shall this serve in the long term?" Then the LORD replied saying, "Perhaps a trip to Berlin where thou shall read menus as though a scribe of their people?" Moses shrugged and said, "Well, the kebob better be great when that happens." The LORD replied, "Some of it is. The beer is always reasonably priced though."</p>

    <p>Then Moses raised his hands to the keys for another whole day and behold, there were two final papers written. Then the Lord spoke unto the people saying, "The days are coming when you will see the end of all final papers in your courses. You will surely know that the papers will be only adequate, but among you are those who are getting married in 29 days and adequate under these circumstances is excellent." And the people rejoiced, for only one final paper remained to be written.</p>

    <p>And Moses said to the people, "Behold, I am 1/3 of the way to never having to write a final paper for a course ever again." And there was great rejoicing amongst them for they had suffered long under the tedious academic prose of the lawgiver.</p>

    <p>Then the LORD spoke unto the Israelites saying, "Look, you can write a final paper in 2 days, but if you're an extrovert it will mean a long time in a room by yourself and you'll feel crazy. So try to avoid that." But the people did not listen to the voice of the LORD and instead they sat on their futons and wrote their papers in two days.</p>

    <p>And then the Lord spake unto Moses saying, "Speak unto the people and tell them, 'You shall surely suffer mild illness in spring. It shall be debilitating enough to make normal life hard, but not bad enough such that you feel good about lying around.'" And Moses replied to the Lord and said, "How long oh Lord?" And the Lord spake unto Moses saying, "Just long enough to be obnoxious." And Lo, it was so. And all the people in the libraries, in the streets, and in their beds snorted and hacked for several weeks. Some chose to watch netflix but suffered great sufferings of guilt.</p>

The strong will tremble, the weak will be mighty, and you will go see Star Wars: Rogue One" And the people rejoiced for their labors were heavy under the weight of PhD applications and they were surely to see Star Wars.</p>
